    "that can be represented as elements of a matrix $x$ of size $n*m$, where $n$ is the number of counterparts and $m$ is the number of grades. Several constraints must be fulfilled to find the correct values of the matrix elements. These constraints are formulated as penalties of a QUBO problem. Solving this QUBO formulation allows us to classify the $n$ counterparts into the $m$ grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 6 report the mathematical definition of the constraints for the QUBO formulation. Here, we provide only a brief overview of the constraints:\n",
    "* **Logic constraint**: given the n counterparts ordered by score, the result of the QUBO problem must be a binary staircase matrix;\n",
    "* **Monotonicity constraint**: the default rate of the grades increases as the grade index increases;\n",
    "* **Heterogeneity constraint**: the default values of two consecutive grades must differ significantly from each other;\n",
    "* **Concentration constraint**: the counterparts are divided into grades to avoid high concentrations of the default rate;\n",
    "* **Grade cardinality threshold constraints**: the number of counterparts per grade is limited from above and below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will implement a function for each of them, except for the heterogeneity one. Indeed, we considered not implementing the heterogeneity constraint in the cost function because including it would introduce too many variables, making the entire problem intractable. The main reason for this is that the heterogeneity constraint we introduced in the Section 6.3 of the WP5 report is of degree 24. Consequently, the corresponding quadratic term that enforces this requirement in the cost function introduces an exponential number of variables, which are necessary for its quadratization. As with the homogeneity test described in Chapter 4 of the WP5 report, we decided to implement only the test for the heterogeneity constraint.\n",

Specifically, the `exact_solver` function relies on the [dimod library](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/ocean/api_ref_dimod/), where the `ExactSolver` method is implemented. Once a QUBO problem has been properly formatted, this method calculates the energy of all possible samples.

Attempting to use it with larger instances results in an error related to insufficient memory to complete execution.\n",

Due to limited access to such hardware, it is preferable to first validate the code using classical quantum simulators. For the purposes of this notebook, we therefore used the `SimulatedAnnealingProblemSampler` function to verify that the implemented algorithm actually produces acceptable results."
